# PCA Test Taxonomy
 In this bachelor's thesis over a thousand specimens still required identification and would eventually be registered in the collection. During these identifications, challenges were encountered in distinguishing two cichlid species, Serranochromis altus (WINEMILLER & KELSO-WINEMILLER, 1991) and Serranochromis angusticeps (BOULENGER, 1907). A taxonomic study based on morphology was conducted on these two species. The specimens identified as belonging to either of these two species were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of an eye-stripe complex (vermiculations around the eye in a star-like pattern). According to the available identification keys, S. altus never possesses this characteristic, while S. angusticeps exhibits the eye-stripe complex. Principal component analyses revealed the presence of two groups, although with a large degree of overlap. The PCA-derived grouping was not based on sex or growth. We could conclude that the eye-stripe complex is not a reliable characteristic for distinguishing the two species, but we were unable to find an alternative differentiating characteristic.
